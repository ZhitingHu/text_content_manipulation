Lillard finished the first half with 25 points , and was quiet in the third quarter before returning to for a typical lights out fourth quarter showing .
Aminu was deadly from the field , and was nearly perfect through the game , but his biggest moment came after a corner 3 , which he completed , turned to Stephen_Curry ( knee ) and stared him down as he walked back on defense late in the game .
Head Coach Steve Kerr said that Curry has a slight chance to play in Game 4 , but with that is dependent on the situation after Game 3 .

Houston started off the season with 3 - straight 20 - point losses , but they appear to be out of that swoon at this point with 4 - straight wins .

The San_Antonio_Spurs defeated the Philadelphia_76ers , 111 - 103 , at Wells Fargo Center on Wednesday .
The Spurs ( 40 - 12 ) have undoubtedly observed that the Sixers ( 18 - 34 ) seem to be a different team from seasons past , when their presence on a schedule almost guaranteed a win .
Philadelphia has been most effective at home , where they 've managed a 12 - 15 record .
It was therefore no surprise that it took double - digit scoring from all 5 San_Antonio starters and success rates of over 50 percent from the field and three - point range for the visitors to tough out a win .

With the Pacers hitting 13 more three - pointers than the Magic , they had little to no chance of making a comeback Tuesday .
The Pacers got a ridiculous amount of production from their bench , as their bench out - scored the Magics 73 - 18 .
That effort was led by Rodney_Stuckey , who went 13 - for - 19 from the field and 6 - for - 9 from the three - point line to score a game - high of 34 points , while also adding 6 rebounds and 7 assists .

The Houston_Rockets defeated the Chicago_Bulls , 115 - 94 , at United Center on Friday evening .
The Rockets ( 45 - 21 ) have been one of the NBA 's best squads all season , and a great deal of their success is rightfully attributed to their prolific offense .
It was the returning Ryan_Anderson , who 'd missed the team 's tilt against the Jazz on Wednesday with a back injury , that led the way with 21 points , 3 rebounds and 1 steal .
Additionally , a stellar defensive effort , 1 that saw Houston limit their hosts to success rates of 39 percent from the field and 23 percent from three - point range , while also forcing them into 18 turnovers , that was pivotal to the win .

Tim_Duncan was coming off his first scoreless performance in his 19 - year career , to post 14 points , 10 rebounds and 4 assists in a great all - around game .
This team just continues to impress and they 'll look to extend their 20 - game winning streak at home on Wednesday against the Utah_Jazz in their next fixture .
They allowed at least 29 points in every single quarter and allowed San_Antonio to shoot over 55 percent from the field .
The bench was especially bad , as no player scored more than 5 points aside from John_Henson who scored just 8 .
All 5 starters scored in double - figures , but it simply was n't enough against a potent offense like the Spurs .
The Atlanta_Hawks ( 59 - 19 ) defeated the Brooklyn_Nets ( 35 - 42 ) 114 - 111 on Wednesday in Brooklyn .
After a big fourth quarter from the Nets , the 2 teams went down to the wire , changing leads 3 times in the last 2 minutes before an Al_Horford dunk and 2 free throws from Jeff_Teague sealed the deal for Atlanta .

Paul_Millsap was out once again with a shoulder injury , while Mike_Muscala got the start in his place , but he had just 9 points ( 4 - 6 FG ) in 24 minutes .

Jarrett_Jack ( 14 ) and Bojan_Bogdanovic ( 12 ) round out the 6 Nets 's players who scored in double figures .
The Nets were hot coming into Wednesday 's matchup as winners of 7 of their last 8 , and while they are still winners of 7 of their last 9 , both those losses came at the hands of the Hawks .
Regardless , the Nets still find themselves in the playoffs and hold a 1 - game lead over the Pacers and Heat for the final spot in the East .
The Chicago_Bulls ( 18 - 12 ) defeated the Indiana_Pacers ( 18 - 13 ) 102 - 100 in overtime on Wednesday .
The game was a tale of 2 halves , with Chicago building a 50 - 40 lead by intermission , largely on the strength of a second period in which they outscored the visitors 29 - 19 .
However , Indiana came out of the locker room ready to play catch - up in the third period , and clawed all the way back to take a 91 - 89 lead on a Monta_Ellis layup with 31 seconds remaining in regulation .
Jimmy_Butler then made a clutch driving layup for the Bulls at the 25 - second mark to knot things up at 91 .
Following Ellis 's missed 30 - foot three - point attempt with 1 second remaining , the contest went into the extra period .
`` Jimmy Buckets '' was the hero again for the home team in the `` fifth quarter '' by notching 4 points , including a game - winning tip - in with 1 seconds remaining to seal the hard - fought victory .

He also added 3 blocks and a sole assist , which came on Butler 's game - winning shot .
While no other starter was able to get into double - digits scoring - wise , 2 very productive performances off the bench were crucial to Chicago 's cause .
With Derrick_Rose sitting with a sore hamstring , Aaron_Brooks showed he had the hot hand early despite yielding the start to Kirk_Hinrich , and ended up playing a robust 41 minutes .
Brooks tallied a season - high 29 points , and was successful on 4 of his 7 three - point tries .
While he did turn the ball over 6 times , he provided some badly - needed scoring punch in Rose 's stead .
2015 first - round pick Bobby_Portis also pitched in significantly off the bench with 16 points , 7 rebounds , 1 steal and 1 block .
The Bulls improved to 18 - 12 and are now in second place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division . They remain home for a New Year 's Day matchup against the Knicks .

Tuesday night against the Jazz , Love posted just 12 points and 9 rebounds in 37 minutes while shooting a sorry 4 - of - 14 from the field and 2 - of - 6 from behind the arc .
In the 3 games he 's played this month , Love has shot over 33 percent from the field just once and is shooting a woeful 27 percent from behind the arc to start the new year .

On Phoenix 's side , meanwhile , rookie Devin_Booker scored a career - high 34 points in 39 minutes .
Despite being one of the youngest rookies , Booker is now just the second member of the 2015 draft class with multiple 30 - point games , joining first overall pick Karl-Anthony_Towns .
In the absence of injured stars Eric_Bledsoe and Brandon_Knight , the fresh - faced rookie has been handed the reigns to the offense , a role that he embraced with his team - high 21 shot attempts on Thursday .

D'Angelo_Russell continued his inconsistent shooting performances , totaling 8 points on 4 - of - 11 from the field , and adding 7 rebounds and a trio of assists .
Roy_Hibbert turned in a serviceable effort at the center spot , collecting 8 points and hauling in 9 boards .

The candidate for surprise line of the night was Salah_Mejri , who tallied 17 points and 9 rebounds , which both surpassed his season totals in those statistics .
If there was 1 blemish here , it would be that Russell_Westbrook was ejected in the second quarter for accumulating 2 technical fouls .
Kevin_Durant stepped up his game in Westbrook 's absence , though , scoring 29 points while snatching down 10 rebounds .
Serge_Ibaka also had a nice 20 - point , 11 - rebound double - double as well .
The New_York_Knicks ( 18 - 19 ) took down the Miami_Heat ( 21 - 14 ) on Wednesday , 98 - 90 , in a battle of 2 of the Eastern Conference 's most improved teams .

The Los_Angeles_Clippers defeated the Philadelphia_76ers , 112 - 100 , at Staples Center on Saturday afternoon .
The Clippers ( 40 - 26 ) were looking to extend a recent winning stretch that had seen them emerge victorious in 3 of their previous 4 games , but knew they 'd have a challenge in the form of the considerably improved Sixers ( 23 - 42 ) .
That came to fruition throughout the first 3 - plus quarters , as Philadelphia actually entered the fourth period in possession of a 79 - 75 advantage .
However , Los_Angeles came alive at that point , outscoring their visitors by a 37 - 21 margin in the final 12 minutes to secure the double - digit win .

The Heat held the Sixers to 38 percent shooting and blocked 14 shots in the win .

The Golden_State_Warriors ( 20 ) defeated the New_Orleans_Pelicans ( 0 - 2 ) 97 - 87 on Monday at Oracle Arena in Oakland in game 2 of their first round matchup of the Western Conference playoffs .
The Pelicans got off to a really quick start in this game , out - scoring the Warriors 28 - 17 in the first quarter , as both Anthony_Davis and Eric_Gordon finished the quarter in double figures .
The Warriors then got a huge spark off the bench in the second quarter from Leandro_Barbosa , who scored 10 of his 12 points during that span , helping get the Warriors to a three - point lead at the break .
After a tight third quarter , the Warriors finally broke out in the fourth , as Klay_Thompson got hot and scored 14 points in the final quarter to help push the Warriors to the 10 - point win and give them the 2 game advantage in the series .

If the Pelicans want to get over the hump and come out with a victory in this series , Evans will need to step it up even more in game 3 .
Norris_Cole provided a nice contribution off the bench as well , scoring 11 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 1 - 3 3Pt , 0 - 1 FT ) in 27 minutes .
These 2 teams will now head to New_Orleans to play game 3 of the series on Thursday .
The Thunder ( 18 - 19 ) held on to knock off the Jazz ( 13 - 24 ) behind 32 points from Kevin_Durant on Friday .

Following a Derrick_Favors free throw , Westbrook fed Dion_Waiters for a dunk to bring the Oklahoma_City lead to 3 .
Then , with the Thunder leading by 1 with 23 seconds to play , Durant found Waiters for a three - pointer that would prove to be the dagger .
In his second game with the Thunder , Waiters finished with 15 points and 4 steals in 27 minutes off the bench .
Westbrook had 25 points and 12 assists , and Durant poured in 32 points to go with 6 assists and 5 boards .

The 2 leading scorers came off the bench too , as Jonathan_Gibson dropped 26 points in his second game with the Mavs and D.J .
Augustin scored 18 for the Magic .

Orlando 's stars were n't any better , as Nikola_Vucevic and Evan_Fournier combined to go 8 - of - 29 from the field .
Amazingly , Dallas was 13 - of - 28 from three - point range , which was half of their makes for the evening ( 26 - of - 77 ) .
Rebounding was the big difference in the game , with Orlando snatching down 50 boards to Dallas 's 34 .
The Washington_Wizards ( 23 - 27 ) fought off a second - half rally from the New_York_Knicks ( 23 - 32 ) to win 111 - 108 at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday .
Despite being outscored by 13 in the third quarter , Washington was able to narrowly pull out a win in the game 's final minutes .
All-Star point guard John_Wall not only led the Wizards in scoring with 28 , but dished out his second - highest assist total of the season with 17 .
Wall played a whopping 43 minutes in 4 quarters and turned the ball over just once despite being the focal point of the Washington offense .
Meanwhile , Wall 's backcourt partner in crime Bradley_Beal drilled 5 three - pointers and poured in 26 points overall .
Beal shot a disappointing 5 - for - 9 from the free - throw line , but more than made up for it with his impressive shooting from the field ( 8 - of - 14 ) and his stellar defense ( 4 steals ) .
Overall , Washington won with a lights - out shooting performance from beyond the arc , as the team shot 16 - for - 26 from deep .
Rebounding , however , proved to be an issue for the Wizards , as they pulled down just 32 boards to New_York 's 46 .
Superstar Carmelo_Anthony was unsurprisingly the leader for his team on Tuesday , as he posted a game - high 33 points to go along with 13 rebounds .
Anthony saw help in the form of Latvian rookie Kristaps_Porzingis , who scored 20 points and blocked 3 shots .
The Knicks struggled , however , to match their opponents 's heat from beyond the arc , as they shot just 31 percent from three - point territory .
They resume action in Brooklyn on Feb. 19 .
The Cleveland_Cavaliers defeated the Oklahoma_City_Thunder , 107 - 91 , at Quicken Loans Arena on Sunday .
Things did n't seem to exactly be pointing in the right direction early on Sunday , as Kevin_Love was forced from the game after 12 minutes with back spasms .
The Thunder ( 28 - 20 ) also held a 24 - 21 lead after 1 quarter , but LeBron_James and Kyrie_Irving turned things up a notch during the second period .
Cleveland outscore OKC by a 37 - 21 margin over that span , building 58 - 45 lead heading into halftime .
Tristan_Thompson and Iman_Shumpert also turned in outstanding supporting efforts in the win , and the Cavs managed to hold their visitors to 37 percent shooting from the field , and a 23 percent success rate from three - point range .
Russell_Westbrook did manage to record yet another triple - double , but was `` contained ' to a manageable 20 points , 12 rebounds , 10 assists , 1 steal and 1 block , shooting just 7 - of - 26 from the field .

The Toronto_Raptors ( 20 ) were able to pull away on the road from the Boston_Celtics ( 1 - 1 ) in the second half of Friday 's game , winning by a score of 113 - 103 .
However , the Raptors eventually used an 80 run in the third quarter to gain separation from the opposition , and maintained that advantage over the final 15 minutes .
Terrence_Ross was a star performer off the bench for Toronto , notching 21 points on 8 - for - 12 shooting .
DeMarre_Carroll knocked down 4 three - pointers to finish with 21 points , while Kyle_Lowry and DeMar_DeRozan both shook off poor shooting nights to combine for 37 points .
The Celtics were undone by the lack of scoring from their starting unit , as only 2 of the 5 starters reached double figures in scoring .
That offensive deficiency was further exacerbated by the team 's ineffectiveness on the glass , with Toronto outrebounding Boston by a 53 - 38 count .
For the second straight game , the Celtics leaned on Isaiah_Thomas to drive the offense , and the guard did n't disappoint with a team - leading 25 points and 7 assists .
Amir_Johnson chipped in 11 points and 8 boards off the bench , while fellow frontcourt reserve Kelly_Olynyk contributed 11 points of his own .
The Miami_Heat defeated the visiting Toronto_Raptors , 104 - 89 , at American Airlines Arena on Saturday evening .
The Raptors ( 38 - 28 ) came out flat on the second night of a back - to - back , resulting in their second straight loss .

Miami then held on through the second half to earn their fourth straight win and come 1 step closer to a spot in the top 8 in the East .
Dion_Waiters was the high - point man for Miami , with 20 points on 6 - of - 10 shooting , including 4 - of - 6 from deep .
Five other players scored in double digits for the Heat , including Goran_Dragic , who chipped in 15 .
Dragic had his night cut short after 17 minutes of action , as he took a hit in the eye , which resulted in swelling .
Hassan_Whiteside double - doubled , with 12 points and 14 rebounds , to go along with 4 blocks , in 33 minutes , while Tyler_Johnson added 16 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting , in 27 minutes off the bench .
Meanwhile , despite shooting 5 - of - 16 , DeMar_DeRozan was the high point man for the Raptors , with 17 points in 28 minutes of action .
Norman_Powell got the start in place of DeMarre_Carroll and finished with 14 points on 5 - of - 14 shooting .
Jonas_Valanciunas finished with 10 points on 5 - of - 6 shooting , and 10 rebounds , in only 21 minutes .
Over the last 5 games , 76ers star Joel_Embiid has been absent due to a knee contusion , and that opened the door for backup center and former No .
3 overall draft pick Jahlil_Okafor to prove his worth to the organization - - or other organizations for that matter .
Okafor has played in 4 of those 5 games , as he sat out for precautionary reasons in 1 , and in those 4 games , he 's given mixed results .
While offensively Okafor has been somewhat productive in averaging 14 points per game following his 16 - point performance Monday , he has n't done so at a very efficient rate .
Okafor has failed to shoot over 50 percent in 3 of those 4 games , and considering how he does the majority of his work near the basket , shooting 46 percent overall in that stretch is not a very impressive mark .
Cleveland was markedly more efficient than the Rockets from the charity stripe , successfully converting 84 of their 31 free - throw attempts .
They out - rebounded the Rockets by a 46 - 32 margin as well , in large part due to James and Tristan_Thompson combining for half of that tally .
The Rockets continue to lean heavily on Harden , who once again paced the team with 41 points while setting up another 30 - plus through his 15 assists .
The remainder of the starting 5 outside of Eric_Gordon continues to struggle to muster consistent offense , however , and went a combined 11 - for - 28 from the field .
The Minnesota_Timberwolves ( 20 ) defeated the Denver_Nuggets ( 1 - 1 ) 95 - 78 Friday .
2015 top overall pick Karl-Anthony_Towns 's coming out party spearheaded the Timberwolves to a rousing victory over one of the more potent offenses in the NBA .
Towns 's deft 59 percent shooting ( 17 - for - 29 ) over his first 2 career games has also been an eye - opener .
Wiggins poured in 18 points to supplement Towns 's outstanding effort , and Zach_LaVine and Kevin_Martin paced Minnesota 's bench with 10 and 14 points , respectively .
The Nuggets could not come close to duplicating their shocking road victory over the Rockets in the opener , enduring mediocre shooting nights from their starting 5 .
First-round pick Emmanuel_Mudiay paced Denver with 15 points and did cut down his turnovers to a respectable 4 after being charged with 11 in the opener .
However , reserve Will_Barton outscored the rest of the Nuggets 's starters with 14 points over 30 minutes , while the normally prolific Danilo_Gallinari could only contribute 10 points on a subpar 4 - of - 13 shooting performance .
Overall , Denver was only able to muster a mediocre 31 team field goal percentage in the loss .
The victory keeps the Timberwolves perfect at 20 and in first place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division .
The loss drops the Nuggets to 1 - 1 and places them into a last place tie in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division .
The Memphis_Grizzlies ( 50 - 21 ) defeated the New_York_Knicks ( 14 - 57 ) 103 - 82 on Monday at Madison Square Garden in New_York .
They currently remain 2 and a half games above the Houston_Rockets for the second seed in the West , but also trail the Golden_State_Warriors by 7 games for the top overall seed .
The Grizzlies were the much better shooting team in this game , going 52 percent from the field and an impressive 58 percent from the three - point line , while the Knicks ended at just 42 percent from the floor and a meager 22 percent from deep .
The Grizzlies 's starting frontcourt came up big again Monday , as they combined to score 56 of the 103 total points .
Zach_Randolph led the way , finishing with a team - high of 23 points ( 9 - 12 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) , to go along with 7 rebounds and 5 assists .
He 's played well of late for Memphis and is averaging 19 points and 7 rebounds over his last 5 games .
Marc_Gasol also had a strong showing , posting 21 points ( 9 - 17 FG , 3 - 5 FT ) and 8 rebounds over 32 minutes .
Gasol shot just 27 percent ( 4 - 15 FG ) from the field during Saturday 's game against the Portland Trail_Blazers , so it was good to see him have a lot more success on Monday .
Jeff_Green chipped in with 12 points ( 4 - 9 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and 3 rebounds as well .
Carter finished with 14 points ( 4 - 8 FG , 4 - 6 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) in 21 minutes , while Koufos recorded 10 points ( 5 - 7 FG ) and 5 rebounds in 16 minutes .
He had combined to go 5 - for - 22 from the floor and just 1 - for - 7 from deep over his last 2 games , so it was a breath of fresh air for Knicks 's fans seeing Galloway shoot a little better Monday .
Andrea_Bargnani did his part as well , posting 18 points ( 8 - 18 FG , 1 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 2 FT ) and 2 blocked shots in 31 minutes .
With Alexey_Shved sidelined with a rib injury , Shane_Larkin moved into the starting lineup , but he contributed just 4 points ( 2 - 7 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt ) and 7 assists in 43 minutes .
While the 76ers won and ended their 8 - game losing streak , they by no means put together a perfect performance .
The 76ers shot a fairly poor 43 percent overall from the field , while the Pelicans managed to shoot just 39 percent .
Philadelphia struggled to make it to the free throw line , shooting just 13 attempts and only making 9 of them ( 69 percent ) .
And while New_Orleans did get to the line more often , shooting 25 shots from the charity stripe , they made just 68 percent of those .
Where the Pelicans excelled was in taking care of the basketball , committing just 12 turnovers on the night , but the 76ers still found a way to be better there , committing just 10 turnovers .
The host Utah_Jazz beat the visiting Los_Angeles_Lakers on Friday , 96 - 89 .
His typical frontcourt partner , French 7 - footer Rudy_Gobert , made a major impact on the defensive end with 4 blocks .
Gobert 's 6 offensive rebounds also helped the Jazz overcome a poor perimeter shooting night , offering Utah a number of second - chance attempts .
The Lakers , meanwhile , received troubling news , as rookie Brandon_Ingram was forced to leave the game with a knee injury after just 4 minutes of play .
It was a tough night for young Lakers in general , as guard D'Angelo_Russell went just 3 - for - 14 from the field , while forward Julius_Randle scored just 7 points and recorded only 4 rebounds .
The Lakers did manage to find a scoring boost off the bench , as sixth man Lou_Williams led the team with 17 .
The Sacramento_Kings ( 11 - 10 ) defeated the Utah_Jazz ( 5 - 16 ) 101 - 92 on Monday at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento .
Despite only having 5 victories on the year , the Jazz put up a fight and kept even with the Kings all the way up until the start of the fourth quarter .
The Kings were able to use a significant rebounding advantage and superior shooting to out - score the Jazz 33 - 24 in the final quarter , thus sealing the 9 - point victory at home .
He scored 16 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 0 - 2 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) and handed out 6 assists in 32 minutes , as he also was continued to be relied upon to make up for the loss of Cousins .
Nik_Stauskas had arguably his best game of the season , as he recorded a season - high of 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 2 - 4 3Pt , 1 - 1 FT ) and 8 rebounds in 30 minutes off the bench .
Gordon_Hayward led the team with 19 points ( 6 - 16 FG , 1 - 7 3Pt , 6 - 10 FT ) and 7 assists , while also matching a season - high with 4 steals .
Alec_Burks chipped in 16 points ( 5 - 11 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 6 - 9 FT ) of his own , as he 's put together a couple of solid games in a row .
He 's combined for 38 points , 12 rebounds and 6 assists in the previous 2 games , giving the Jazz a little bit of everything .
Both Enes_Kanter and Trey_Burke finished with 13 points , but it was n't enough to propel the Jazz past the Kings .
The visitors shot 42 percent from the field and 36 percent from three - point range , notably superior to the Bulls 's respective 39 and 24 percent tallies .
Dwyane_Wade 's 21 points led the Bulls , while Nikola_Mirotic 's 20 points in 30 minutes off the bench followed .
Jimmy_Butler supplied 16 points , 5 assists , 4 rebounds and 2 steals .
Taj_Gibson and Jeremi Grant had matching 10 - point efforts , and Robin_Lopez hauled in 12 boards .

The Atlanta_Hawks ( 40 - 8 ) survived a scare from the Philadelphia_76ers ( 10 - 38 ) Saturday night , eking out a 91 - 85 win Saturday at the Philips Arena .
Atlanta saw a 21 - point lead in the second quarter evaporate as Luc Richard Mbah a Moute tied it up at 81 with 3:19 to go in the fourth .
Dennis_Schroder was huge down the stretch in this game , hitting the go - ahead 3 with 1:35 remaining .
Philadelphia lacked a sense of urgency after a timeout with under 1 minute to go and was unable to close the gap .
Al_Horford turned in another strong performance Saturday , recording 23 points and 11 rebounds to help Atlanta extend its winning streak to 19 games .
Atlanta came into the game missing its top 2 small forwards , with DeMarre_Carroll and Thabo_Sefolosha sidelined with injuries .
Kent_Bazemore filled in at small forward and contributed 3 points and 3 rebounds over 30 minutes .
Dennis_Schroder added 15 points and 6 assists in 28 minutes off the bench .

Orlando never trailed as they jumped out to a 13 - point lead within the game 's first 7 minutes .
Magic center Dewayne_Dedmon opened the game with a 60 run on his own and scored 12 points in the frame , after which Orlando owned a 32 - 22 lead .
The Bucks trailed by 14 at halftime and although a late run brought it within 4 points late in the fourth quarter , it was n't enough to close the gap .
Former Buck Ersan_Ilyasova led Orlando with 22 points as he shot a blistering 10 - 13 from the floor and made both his three - point attempts .
Elfrid_Payton recorded adouble - double with 11 points and 11 assists , and Mario_Hezonja scored 19 points ( 7 - 11 FG , 3 - 6 3PT ) , dished 7 assists and swiped 5 steals .
Dedmon finished with 17 points and added 8 rebounds , 3 steals and 3 blocks .
Orlando was outshot by the Bucks , but the Magic notched an absurd 19 steals and turned the ball over just 10 times themselves .
Greg_Monroe 's 23 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 5 - 6 FT ) for Milwaukee led all scorers .
Milwaukee shot 53 percent from the field but just 3 - 15 ( 20 percent ) from three - point land and committed fewer assists ( 18 ) than turnovers ( 23 ) .
The Denver_Nuggets ( 24 - 37 ) defeated the Los_Angeles_Lakers ( 12 - 50 ) 117 - 107 at Pepsi Center on Wednesday .
It was far from a pretty showcase between the 2 teams , but the Lakers received another strong performance from rookie point guard D'Angelo_Russell , who scored 24 points on 9 - of - 21 shooting , to go along with 1 rebound and 6 assists in 36 minutes .
Russell has broken through in the second half of the season , and heading into Wednesday , he had posted a 5 game stretch averaging 21 points , 4 rebounds , 5 assists on 55 percent shooting .
That stat line is the lone bright spot for Los_Angeles aside from Brandon_Bass 's defensive improvement over the last 10 games .
Bass added 11 points on 4 - of - 7 shooting off the bench , but helped bring his team within striking distance of the Nuggets down the stretch , forcing a couple of turnovers and defending both the paint and wing at an exceptional level .

The Lakers will host the Atlanta_Hawks ( 33 - 28 ) on Friday .
The Nuggets held on to win , but it looked bleak after surviving an 8 minutes stretch of play between the third and fourth quarters where they scored an underwhelming 2 points .
Denver shot 1 - of - 12 during that stretch , and save for the Lakers inability to rebound the ball , the 8 minute stretch could have been extended .
Augustin , who rallied the Nuggets after the scoring drought and finished with 26 points , 7 rebounds , 5 assists and 1 steal on 7 - of - 11 shooting in 23 minutes off of the bench .
Emmanuel_Mudiay put together a strong game , and the rookie matchup with Russell made for the most entertainment , as he rounded out the box score with 22 points , 4 rebounds and 7 assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting .
The Nuggets will host the Brooklyn_Nets ( 17 - 44 ) on Friday .

Sunday , even Griffin succumbed to the malaise that currently seems to surround Los_Angeles , mustering a season - low 9 points , along with 6 rebounds , 4 assists and a pair of steals .
He also turned the ball over a season - high 6 times in a forgettable performance versus a Raptors defense that had been vulernable to opposing power forwards coming into the game .
Toronto enjoyed impressive contributions from every starter , with DeMarre_Carroll and DeMar_DeRozan leading the way with a pair of 21 - point efforts .
Kyle_Lowry pitched in with his second double - double of the season ( 13 points , 10 assists ) , while veteran power forward Luis_Scola continued a resurgent age - 35 season with 20 points and 8 rebounds .

Fastbreak points and points in the paint were huge as well , with the Thunder outscoring the Heat , 58 - 32 in the paint and 16 - 4 in fastbreak points .
