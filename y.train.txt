This was the seventh straight loss for the Hornets , as they have hit a major slide that has put them in danger of losing their position in the top 8 in the East .

Westbrook entered Friday 's matchup with averages of 31 points , 10 assists , and 9 rebounds per game .
Westbrook was not the only dominant Thunder player on Friday , though , as the team hit an impressive 16 three - pointers on 57 percent shooting .

The Clippers , meanwhile , saw high scoring totals from the All-Star combo of Blake_Griffin and Chris_Paul , who combined for 42 points .
All-NBA center DeAndre_Jordan made an impact with a team - high 13 rebounds , helping keep the Clippers even with the glass - dominating Thunder .

The Celtics ( 10 ) came into this game as a 12 - point favorite , but the Nets ( 0 - 1 ) made them work for a relieving win .
A 36 - 25 fourth quarter is how Brooklyn crawled back in the game , but Boston did just enough to hold on .
The offense was incredibly efficient for the Celtics , as they shot 54 percent from the field and recorded 36 assists on their 48 made baskets .
The 22 combined blocks and steals for Boston doubled up that of Brooklyn , who recorded just 11 in total .

The host New_Orleans_Pelicans defeated the Boston_Celtics , 106 - 105 , at Smoothie King Center on Monday .
The key for New_Orleans was their defense , as they held Boston to 40 percent from the field and 29 percent from three - point range .
Rim protection killed Boston as well , as they failed to record 1 block in their loss .
The assist - to - turnover ratio kept the Celtics hanging around , as they committed 12 turnovers to 19 assists , while the Pelicans committed 17 turnovers to their 16 assists .
The Celtics ( 5 - 5 ) continue to struggle without Al_Horford ( concussion ) and Jae_Crowder ( ankle ) and this was easily their worst loss of the season .

The Bucks came into this game as the worst rebounding team in the NBA , but actually outrebounded Dallas 52 - 34 in the loss .
The difference for the Mavericks were the turnovers , as they committed just 4 to the Bucks 17 .

For Denver , meanwhile , forward Kenneth_Faried put in work on the glass to come away with a team - high 17 rebounds .

Off the bench , forward Wilson_Chandler led the team with 26 points to go along with 9 rebounds .
A short - handed Bulls squad that was missing Jimmy_Butler , Dwyane_Wade , Nikola_Mirotic and Paul_Zipser due to injury was no match for a full - strength Minnesota unit , which jumped out a 34 - 17 first - quarter lead .

The Los_Angeles_Clippers ( 41 - 21 ) defeated the Dallas_Mavericks ( 33 - 31 ) 109 - 90 at American Airlines Center on Monday .
Chris_Paul struggled in the first half , but came out an entirely different player for the second half , scoring 18 points in the third quarter to help the Clippers run up the score .
Before Paul 's offensive outburst , the Mavericks kept the game tight knit through the first 2 quarters of play , but that was mostly on the part of both teams failing to find a shooting rhythm and not capitalizing on turnovers .
Paul went on to lead all scorers in the contest with 27 points , in addition to 4 rebounds , 7 assists and 3 steals on 12 - of - 18 shooting .
The Clippers improved to 40 - 7 on the season when Paul surpasses 20 points , as well as picking up a needed win to keep the 3 - seed within striking distance after a resilient 10 game stretch .

The remainder of the Mavericks starting lineup combined a lowly 5 - of - 27 shooting , including no made field goals from Wesley_Matthews and Zaza_Pachulia .
Nowitzki finished with 22 points and 6 rebounds .
The bench was eventful , seeing as Rick Carlisle used 8 players sporadically through the game , and once the blowout was on , he turned to Justin_Anderson , Salah_Mejri and Dwight_Powell , who all have seen very little playing time this season .
Raymond_Felton logged more minutes than starter Deron_Williams , and totaled 10 points , 3 rebounds and 2 assists in just under 30 minutes of play .
Dallas , as a unit , shot 37 percent from the floor , and were outplayed statistically by the Clippers in rebounding , assists , blocks and turnovers .
The Mavericks will host the Detroit_Pistons ( 32 - 31 ) on Wednesday .
The Pelicans ( 45 - 37 ) pulled off a 108 - 103 victory over the Spurs ( 55 - 27 ) on Wednesday , clinching a playoff berth .

The Pelicans jumped out to a 34 - 19 lead in the first quarter .
Going into the fourth , the Pelicans led 82 - 73 .

Tim_Duncan and Kawhi_Leonard combined for 29 points and 20 rebounds .
The Pelicans had the Spurs 's number all year , finishing their season series 3 - 1 .
While the Blazers found it nearly impossible to knock down a shot , especially Damian_Lillard , Griffin thrived on the court with 22 points , 13 rebounds , 5 assists , 2 steals and 1 block on 7 - of - 14 shooting .
As a unit , Los_Angeles shot 44 percent from the field , which bested Portland 's lowly effort of 35 percent shooting .
Lillard finished just 1 - of - 10 from the field , and was unable to bury a 3 on 4 attempts .

The turnover differential was the key , as the Timberwolves commuted just 10 , which is almost half as many as the Jazz .
It 's 1 thing to play without Rudy_Gobert , but this offense has no punch without Derrick_Favors and Alec_Burks .
Withey tallied 13 points and 9 rebounds filling in for Favors and Burke scored 23 points off the bench .
Ricky_Rubio did a great job of setting up the offense , as he dished out 17 assists to go along with 10 points in the win .

Thompson was lights out from behind the arc , as he knocked down 7 - of - 11 shots from deep , while Green stuffed the box score .
James_Harden did not go out quietly , and through most of the game , the all - star shooting guard was responsible for half of his team 's points through 3 quarters , but he also committed far too many turnovers .
The Warriors capitalized on 17 Rockets turnovers , which only aided to the home team 's lead from the get go .
Harden finished with 35 points , 6 rebounds , 6 assists , 2 steals and 7 turnovers on 12 - of - 23 shooting .
Dwight_Howard was a monster on the boards and bullied Andrew_Bogut around in the paint , as he contributed 8 points and 21 rebounds and 5 assists in the contest .

Dallas welcomed Chandler_Parsons ( back ) back to the lineup after he missed Saturday 's 105 - 98 loss to the Golden_State_Warriors on Saturday .
Parsons played just 23 minutes in the win , but his lack of extended run was likely due to the fact that the game was a blowout .

New_York has dropped 2 straight and 12 of their last 13 .
Carmelo_Anthony continues to play through his lingering knee soreness , scoring a game - high 26 points Tuesday .

Kemba_Walker did n't shoot much better , as he went 4 - for - 13 to tally 14 points , 4 assists and 4 steals in the loss .

The Trail_Blazers now currently sit in the 8 - seed in the Western Conference and that 's quite the accomplishment considering the preseason expectations .
While DeMar_DeRozan is easily having the best offensive season of his 8 - year NBA career , Thursday 's performance marked the first time this season where the All-Star shooting guard had back - to - back games with at least 40 points .

The Indiana offense was n't shabby either , as they shot a cool 56 percent from the field and 41 percent from three - point range .

The Rockets looked like 2 entirely different teams during the first and second halves while visiting Utah .

Harden finished with 30 points , 5 rebounds and 7 assists on 9 - of - 25 shooting .
Dwight_Howard added 16 points and 13 rebounds , while Harrell 's defensive prowess was only highlighted statistically by his plus/minus of 9 .

Utah continued to find Rodney_Hood around the perimeter and the starting guard turned in 23 points on 5 - of - 6 3 - point shooting .
Gordon_Hayward continues to regress in 2015 - 2016 , as the max contract forward added 20 points on 39 percent shooting , to go along with 7 rebounds and 3 assists .

The Pistons built their largest lead of the game in the third quarter at 82 - 71 , but an Al_Horford three - pointer kickstarted a 13 - 2 Hawks run to tie the game .
Over that span , Atlanta turned a 103 - 103 tie into a 113 - 104 lead , a lead they would n't relinquish .
Jeff_Teague led the Hawks with 22 points and 9 assists , as he did the majority of his scoring at the free throw line ( 12 - 13 FT ) .

Kyle_Lowry picked up some of the slack left behind by DeRozan , scoring a team - high 29 points in 41 minutes .

The Miami_Heat ( 16 - 10 ) defeated the Portland Trail_Blazers ( 11 - 18 ) 116 - 109 on Sunday .
The visitors were unsurprisingly led by Damian_Lillard , who tallied 32 points , 9 assists , 2 rebounds and 1 steal .

The Trail_Blazers fell to 11 - 18 and currently reside in last place in the Western Conference 's Northwest Division .
The point total for Deng largely consisted of the season - high 5 three - pointers that he drained on the afternoon .

Miami improved to 16 - 10 and remains in first place in the Eastern Conference 's Southeast Division .
Midway through March , Jae_Crowder went through a tough stretch where he failed to score in double figures for 5 straight games .

The frustration was beginning to overcome Cleveland , although the timing could not have been worse seeing as they just ripped off 7 straight points to bring the Jazz lead within striking distance .
Kyrie_Irving shot his team out of many opportunities , but the poor shot selection was not entirely on the point guard , as the Cavs shot just under 40 percent as a unit .

James finished with 23 points , 12 rebounds and 3 assists on 10 - of - 20 shooting .

The Celtics had a big first half , out - scoring the Hawks 66 - 50 , but were unable to keep their momentum going into the third quarter , and allowed the Hawks to come all the way back and take the victory .
Despite being out - rebounded 42 - 31 , the Hawks were still able to force the Celtics into 23 turnovers , giving them enough of an advantage to grab a 4 - point victory .
Considering he 's averaging 13 points on the year , it was a nice surprise for the Hawks to get some extra offensive production out of Korver .

The 7 assists were a season - high for Millsap , as he came into this game averaging just 3 .

Jackson had a surprising season - high 11 rebounds , but shot only 3 - for - 11 from the field .
Continuing to come off the bench since returning from MCL surgery , Anthony_Morrow struggled mightily as well , shooting only 1 - for - 9 from the field and 0 - for - 2 from beyond the arc for 4 points .

Now , in his previous 2 games , Payton has totaled 35 points , 20 rebounds and 22 assists .

With the game going back and forth all throughout the fourth quarter , the Grizzlies finally got some separation with about 4 minutes left in the game and never looked back to secure the 6 - point victory in front of their raucous home crowd .

They did it on the defensive side of the ball as well though , limiting the Trail_Blazers 's frontcourt to a combined 24 points .

The Wizards had been mired in an offensive slump of epic proportions recently , having scored 87 points or less over their last 3 games .
The All-Star 's recent performances had served as a microcosm of the team 's overall offensive struggles , with Wall having tallied 20 points or less in all 11 of Washington 's November contests , and having scored in single digits twice over that span .
However , the light went on for the Wizards 's point guard on Tuesday , as he exploded for a season - high 35 points and added 10 assists , 4 rebounds and 5 steals .

The fact that the Wizards had come in to Tuesday 's game giving up the fifth - most points per game to opposing power forwards ( 22 ) made Love 's final stat line all the more disappointing .
J.R. Smith ( 13 points ) and Mo_Williams ( 12 points ) did their best to contribute , but Smith in particular suffered through a third consecutive sub - par shooting night ( 3 - for - 14 ) .
Matthew Delladedova paced the Cavs 's bench with a 15 - point effort over 27 minutes .
Cleveland fell to 13 - 5 but still retains sole possession of first place in the Eastern Conference 's Central Division .

The Atlanta_Hawks ( 18 - 7 ) went on the road and made a statement , beating the Cleveland_Cavaliers ( 14 - 10 ) 127 - 98 on Wednesday .
Schroder did a nice job running the offense , and in just 22 minutes , he had 10 points ( 4 - 6 FG , 0 - 1 3Pt , 2 - 2 FT ) , with 10 assists .
The most surprising showing though , had to be from Shelvin_Mack off the bench , who racked up 23 minutes and scored an impressive 24 points ( 7 - 8 FG , 6 - 6 3Pt , 4 - 4 FT ) , with 3 assists and 2 rebounds .
Atlanta showed up across the board , with 8 players scoring at least 9 points in an impressive win .

Wes Matthews was the Mavericks second leading scorer with 15 points ( 5 - 16 FG , 5 - 11 3PT ) as Dallas could n't get anybody going besides Nowitzki .

Rising star Avery_Bradley led the way with 23 points , while point guard Isaiah_Thomas had a 21 - point , 13 - assist double - double .
Boston has exceeded most expert 's expectations this season , now sitting 4 games above .500 and coming off a back - to - back in which they defeated the Eastern Conference 's second seed and came seconds away from snapping the Golden_State_Warriors 's historic win streak .
Meanwhile , the loss comes as a bit of a momentum killer for Charlotte , who had won 5 of their previous 6 games .
In his first year with the Hornets , Batum has been impeccable , putting up impressive averages of 17 points , 7 rebounds , and 5 assists and helping the lottery team transform into one of the Eastern Conference 's toughest matchups .
Point guard Kemba_Walker , meanwhile , had an off shooting night , going just 5 - 15 from the floor .

The Dallas_Mavericks defeated the New_Orleans_Pelicans , 96 - 83 , at American Airlines Center on Saturday .
These are 2 teams on the outside looking in for the playoffs and the Mavericks were able to escape with a huge win to get them closer to that 8 - seed .
Despite New_Orleans leading by 6 points after the first quarter , Dallas took care of business from there by winning the other 3 quarters by at least 4 points .
In fact , the Mavericks outscored the Pelicans , 49 - 34 , in the second half .
Defense was key , as they held New_Orleans to 40 percent from the field and 21 percent from three - point range , while forcing 19 turnovers .
The Pelicans ( 23 - 36 ) now have 2 double - digit losses since acquiring DeMarcus_Cousins and the growing pains are slower than most anticipated .
Anthony_Davis stepped up though , as he led the team with 39 points and 14 rebounds .
Cousins finished with just 12 points , but provided 15 rebounds , 6 assists and 3 steals .
Jrue_Holiday was the only other Pelican in double figures , as he collected 18 points , 7 rebounds and 6 assists .

The Indiana_Pacers ( 35 - 43 ) defeated the New_York_Knicks ( 15 - 63 ) 102 - 86 on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden in New_York .
The Nets remain in that eighth spot and own just a 1 game lead over the Pacers , so they 'll need to come out victorious in the majority of their final 4 games of the regular season if they want to play in the postseason .
Despite turning the ball over 17 times compared to just 11 from the Knicks , the Pacers made up for it with their rebounding , as they posted a 54 - 34 advantage .
Roy_Hibbert notched a double - double in the win , finishing with 11 points ( 5 - 9 FG , 1 - 2 FT ) and 11 rebounds over just 16 minutes .

Tim Hardaway JR , Quincy_Acy and Jason_Smith all added 12 points of their own off the bench .
The Miami_Heat ( 15 - 9 ) defeated the Brooklyn_Nets ( 7 - 18 ) 104 - 98 on Wednesday night .

Miami shot 53 percent from the field and outrebounded the Nets 44 - 35 in the win .
Dwyane_Wade shot just 3 - for - 16 in his most previous game , but was spectacular here .
Hassan_Whiteside had been struggling lately but had a nice game here , tallying 20 points and 13 rebounds .
Goran_Dragic also continued his recent good form , as he totaled 16 points , 5 assists , 3 rebounds and 2 steals in the victory .
This 4 - headed monster of Wade , Whiteside , Dragic and Chris_Bosh is a scary combo and they should be able to compete with anyone if all 4 are on their game .
The Nets have n't been as bad as their 7 - 18 record would indicate and they just can n't seem to close games out late .
Brook_Lopez led the team with 25 points , but Jarrett_Jack was the best player on Wednesday .
Jack tallied 22 points and 10 assists and continues to show that he 's a legitimate starting point guard in this league .
The Oklahoma_City_Thunder ( 22 - 10 ) defeated the Milwaukee_Bucks ( 12 - 21 ) 131 - 123 on Tuesday night .
The difference in the game was the free - throw shooting , as the Thunder went 37 - for - 40 from the charity stripe , while the Bucks went just 15 - for - 22 .

Cameron_Payne also had his best game as a pro , as he scored a career - high 16 points off the bench in just 16 minutes .
If the bench can score 40 - plus regularly with Durant and Westbrook doing what they do , this team will be impossible to beat .
Kristaps_Porzingis tallied 20 points in his return to lead the Knicks .
New_York also limited the Magic to 41 percent shooting overall and 20 percent ( 5 - for - 25 ) from three - point range .

Aaron_Gordon shook off a quad contusion to register 10 points .
Jeff_Green chipped in with 11 points off the bench .
Westbrook 's 51 - point triple - double was far from efficient , as the guard committed 5 turnovers and took 44 shots in the effort - filled performance Friday against the Suns .
Oklahoma_City could have ended the game much earlier , as they missed the last 3 shots in the final 30 seconds of regulation to send the game to overtime .
Westbrook actually recorded his 10th assist in overtime , so if it were n't for the extra session , Westbrook would have fallen 1 assist shy of a triple - double in back - to - back games .
T.J Warren , Devin_Booker , Eric_Bledsoe and Brandon_Knight combined for 87 of the Suns 110 points .
In contrast , the Thunder got 72 combined points from Westbrook and Victor_Oladipo .

The All-Star drained 7 three - pointers and had 5 rebounds and 4 assists in what was yet another astounding night for the Celtics 's star .

The Hornets center exploded Thursday for his highest scoring output in almost a full year , coming within 3 points of the 34 he 'd posted Nov. 7 , 2014 versus the Hawks .
The most eye - popping statistic from Jefferson 's stellar night was undoubtedly his accuracy from the field , with Big Al draining buckets at a blistering 83 percent clip ( 15 - of - 18 ) .
The Hornets were also the beneficiaries of Marvin_Williams 's third double - double in 5 games , and Kemba_Walker 's 14 - point effort .

Kawhi_Leonard led San_Antonio in scoring and contributed 24 points , 6 rebounds and 2 assists on 7 - of - 15 shooting .

Most notably , Walker is finishing over 50 percent in the paint , a trend that many analysts are highlighting Stephen_Curry for improving during the offseason as well .
The Hornets also look to Jeremy_Lamb , who came over from Oklahoma_City during the offseason , and matched Walker 's 22 points in 29 minutes off the bench .
The loss of Al_Jefferson for a reported 6 weeks is a major blow to the frontcourt , and Marvin_Williams and Cody_Zeller combo was only good 8 points and 16 boards .
Shooting 44 percent as a unit will likely get you a competitive game with solid chance at a win , but the Warriors completed 52 percent of their shots , which almost always will result in a loss for the opposition .

The Bulls will take on the sixth seeded Milwaukee_Bucks ( 41 - 41 ) when the playoffs begin this weekend .
Paul_Millsap and DeMarre_Carroll each played 27 minutes but other than that no Atlanta player saw the floor for more than 23 minutes .
Mike_Conley 's horrid 3 - of - 14 shooting performance that led to 13 points Thursday against the Clippers was as uncharacteristic as it gets for the veteran point guard , especially when you consider what he was producing coming into Thursday 's game .
In the 5 games prior to Thursday 's blowout , Conley was averaging 29 points per game , but most importantly , he was doing so at a very efficient rate , shooting 55 percent from the field in those 5 games .

In contrast , the 5 bench players for the Celtics combined for just 40 points and 15 rebounds .
Brook_Lopez is Brooklyn 's best player , but he tallied just 7 points and 5 rebounds on 1 - for - 7 shooting in the loss .

The 44 three - point attempts for the Nets were a franchise record , topping their previous high of 40 .
These teams will square off again Nov. 23 at Brooklyn .

The Thunder point guard is now the first player ever to record 100 points , 30 rebounds , and 30 assists through the first 3 games of a season .
The game comes on the heels of a historic night for Westbrook on Friday , in which the guard recorded the first 50 - point triple - double since 1975 .
There was a downside to Westbrook 's night , however , as he turned the ball over 7 times .

This has been a trend this season , as while Davis has managed to average 30 points per game to start the season , his team is averaging just 101 points .
That is 30 percent of his team 's total points , and while the overall numbers Davis is putting up are impressive , they are n't translating to wins .
In fact , they are n't coming close , and with the next highest per - game average Tim_Frazier 's 13 points per game , Davis will desperately need some help offensively going forward if the Pelicans want to notch a single victory .
In the 13 games prior to Wednesday night LaMarcus_Aldridge played at least 30 minutes , he never failed to score less than 10 points .
In fact , Aldridge scored less than 10 points while playing at least 30 minutes just twice in all of last season .
Wednesday night against the Mavericks , Aldridge notched his lowest scoring total - - 5 points - - since joining San_Antonio , and he did so in 32 minutes of playing time .
And while Wednesday 's struggle does not indicate the season Aldridge has had so far , as he is still averaging 18 points and 7 rebounds .
Those numbers , however , are still subpar by Aldridge 's standards , as after averaging at least 21 points and 8 rebounds in 5 straight years with Portland , the power forward 's numbers have dipped to 18 points and under 7 rebounds per game .

Lillard poured in 29 points on 11 - of - 24 shooting , to go along with 10 rebounds and 3 assists .

Tuesday was yet another example of Wall being at his best as 1 point guard , and when he 's at his best , his team typically is as well .
In Tuesday 's win over the Suns , Wall dished out 14 assists to go along with his 25 points , and this season , when Wall shares the ball as effectively as he did against Phoenix , the Wizards are almost impossible to beat .
In the 19 games where Wall has recorded at least 13 assists this season , Washington is 15 - 4 , with 3 of those losses - - against the Grizzlies , Thunder and Spurs - - coming in the first 18 games of the regular season .

Memphis had a chance to tie the game on the final possession , but a mistimed pass from Mike_Conley to Marc_Gasol resulted in 1 turnover , eventually sending Justise_Winslow to the free throw line where he extended the lead to 3 points .
Mike_Conley came a few inches away on a 55 foot hail mary with 1 left , but the miracle did not come to fruition .
Dwyane_Wade turned in a vintage performance with 5 minutes left in the game , where the 3 time NBA champion drove the lane for a clutch layup and followed up with the go ahead midrange jumper to put the Heat up 98 - 97 with under 24 seconds left .
Wade finished with 14 points , 4 rebounds and 2 assists on 7 - of - 16 shooting .

Mike_Miller started in place of Smith at shooting guard but only played 16 minutes .
He hit 1 three - pointer and grabbed 5 rebounds in his time on the floor , but his team was clearly missing the spark that Smith provides .

A 5 - point third quarter proved to be the difference in a frustrating loss for the Nuggets .

However , Wednesday 's 35 percent shooting performance did them no favors , as Boston was able to handily walk away with the victory .

Center Ian_Mahinmi saw an increase in playtime after it was announced that rookie big man Myles_Turner ( hand ) will miss at least the next 4 weeks with a chip fracture in his thumb .

The Chicago_Bulls ( 12 - 8 ) resisted a late surge by the Los_Angeles_Clippers ( 13 - 10 ) to hang onto a much - needed win .

Despite a lackluster shooting night ( 4 - 14 FGM , 0 - 2 3PM ) , Bulls star Jimmy_Butler was able to control the game in other ways , distributing the ball well for 8 assists and recording both 2 steals and 2 blocks .
Chicago 's other reigning All-Star , Pau_Gasol , matched Butler 's defensive stats while leading the way with a big 24 points on offense .

Things were n't much better for frontcourt partner Tobias_Harris , who shot just 3 - for - 11 from the field on Wednesday .
Perhaps the biggest issue for Detroit , however , was the gap in perimeter shooting ; the Pistons hit just 4 three - pointers while allowing a whopping 20 for Cleveland .
Game 3 will take place in Detroit .
While the final score may indicate that Tuesday 's game between the Thunder and Jazz went wire - to - wire , Oklahoma_City actually had control of the game through the first 3 quarter thanks in large part to their impressive shooting from behind the arc .

Livingston had 14 of his 18 points in the second quarter to help the Warriors gain the lead going into halftime .

Isaiah_Thomas once again led the way for the Celtics , scoring a game - high 25 points despite shooting just 2 - of - 10 from behind the arc .

The 24 points matched a season - high for him , but it was n't enough to push the Wizards to a win .

The Raptors ( 45 - 29 ) have managed to remain in serious contention despite the ongoing absence of Kyle_Lowry ( wrist ) , and DeMar_DeRozan has unsurprisingly been a major reason why .
The All-Star guard had rattled off a pair of 40 - point efforts recently and was in a potentially advantageous position for more of the same Monday , as the Magic ( 27 - 47 ) had been particularly vulnerable to shooting guards .
DeRozan had also excelled in previous games against Orlando this season and the pattern held true once more , as he scored a game - high 36 points and added 3 assists and 2 rebounds .
Toronto saw 5 other players score in double digits as well and tallied stellar success rates of 59 percent from the field and 67 percent from three - point range .

Surprisingly , Mike_Dunleavy was the Bulls highest score , as he finished with 23 points ( 9 - 15 FG , 5 - 9 3Pt ) and 5 rebounds .
He 's averaging only 9 points on the year , so it was a nice surprise for the Bulls .

After scoffing at the notion of doubling his assist numbers under new coach Mike D'Antoni , guard James_Harden is leading the league in assists through 17 games .
Harden posted yet another double - double in Sunday 's win , scoring a team - high 38 points to go with 10 assists .
Harden 's increased assist totals have just been 1 statistical effect of D'Antoni 's run - and - gun offense , as the Rockets have upped their three - point shooting numbers significantly .
A game after taking an NBA-record 50 three - pointers , the Rockets took 36 threes on Sunday .
Harden hit 5 , while bench guard Eric_Gordon hit 6 en route to 26 points on the night .

Although they coughed up 20 turnovers , the Warriors were able to find a steady offensive flow , running a double - digit lead for the majority of the game .
Sunday 's outing was nothing but bad news for Cleveland , as All-Star Kevin_Love was held to just 20 minutes after suffering a concussion diagnosis .
While Love suffered injury , fellow All-Star Kyrie_Irving simply struggled , scoring only 10 points and dishing just 1 assist .
Only former MVP LeBron_James managed to fill the stat sheet on Sunday , as he finished with 19 points , 8 rebounds , and 9 assists .

While Thomas led the way scoring for his team with 19 points , he just a miserable 4 - of - 21 ( 19 percent ) from the field and 1 - of - 6 from behind the arc .
In the 13 games Thomas has played in this February , he 's managed to shoot over 50 percent from the field just twice , while he has now shot under 40 percent 4 different times .
Thomas 's saving grace has come at the free throw line , where he has never wavered and is shooting an impressive 90 percent from this month .

Wiggins , who is averaging 21 points on 48 percent shooting in January , departed late in the fourth quarter due to flu - like symptoms .
The Wolves were still without Ricky_Rubio , Nikola_Pekovic and Kevin_Martin , but all 3 players are expected to return in the near future .

After a 37 - point second quarter , the Lakers took an 8 - point lead into halftime , however the Grizzlies fought back to tie it up at 82 heading into the fourth .
Memphis led 103 - 97 with 55 seconds left but the Lakers were not done as Lou_Williams was fouled on a jumper and completed the three - point play to make it a 1 - possession game .

Overall , Charlotte managed to score the ball at a highly efficient 52 percent from the field , while Indiana hit just 44 percent of its shots .
While superstar Paul_George had a typically stellar outing ( 22 points , 8 rebounds , 6 assists ) , the rest of the Pacers were relatively unable to get it going .
Rookie Myles_Turner , who has turned heads with his recent play , scored just 10 points and pulled down only 5 rebounds .
Monta_Ellis also disappointed , posting just 10 points , 4 assists , and 1 rebound on the night .
As a team , Indiana was simply unable to defend Charlotte on the perimeter , getting torched for over 50 percent shooting and 12 three - pointers .
It 's pretty safe to say that Russell_Westbrook has had a dominant stretch of basketball , with Monday 's 32 - point , 13 - rebound , 12 - assist performance serving as his sixth straight triple - double and lead to the Thunder 's sixth straight victory .
Anthony_Morrow played 26 minutes off the bench in Monday 's victory and scored 15 points on 5 - of - 8 shooting from the field and 4 - of - 6 shooting from behind the arc .
Over the team 's winning streak , Morrow has now played 25 minutes per game and is averaging 11 points while shooting 49 percent from the field and 45 percent on 3 - pointers .

Versatile wing Will_Barton earned the start on Monday for Denver and led the team with 31 points , also pulling down 8 rebounds and dishing out 5 assists .
As a team , Denver hit a stellar 50 percent of its shots while draining 11 three - pointers .
Dallas ( 20 - 31 ) lost a 4 - game win streak on Monday , and did so in unfortunate style .
A 22 - point halftime deficit proved too much for Dallas to overcome , as there were no inklings of a Super Bowl -esque comeback in Denver .
Jimmy_Butler spearheaded the overtime victory with a 42 - point , 10 - rebound double - double .
He also put matters away with a 25 - foot jumper with 17 seconds remaining in overtime that gave Chicago a 121 - 116 lead at the time .

The Oklahoma_City_Thunder defeated the Utah_Jazz , 112 - 104 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Saturday afternoon .
The Jazz ( 41 - 25 ) learned shortly before tip - off that star center Rudy_Gobert would miss his first game of the season due to knee soreness .
That left Utah without a key rim protector against the Russell_Westbrook and the Thunder ( 37 - 29 ) in the battle of Western Conference playoff contenders .
Both teams shot very well , with the Jazz posting respective success rates of 48 percent from the floor and 45 percent from behind the arc , and the Thunder draining 50 percent of their overall shot attempts .
However , without their dominant big man down low , Utah lost the rebounding battle by a 43 - 36 margin .
The Jazz 's scoring distribution was rather unorthodox , with no starter hitting double digits in the scoring column and the top 2 point totals therefore emanating from the bench .
Dante_Exum led the way with 22 points , which he supplemented with 1 rebound and 1 assist .
He received 26 minutes with starting point guard George_Hill somewhat limited by a troublesome toe .
Alec_Burks followed with 21 points , 7 rebounds and 2 assists .
Trey_Lyles was the third productive reserve , as he posted 10 points , 5 rebounds , 1 assist , 1 steal and 1 block .
The first unit was paced by matching 9 - point efforts from Hill and Gordon_Hayward .
However , Rodney_Hood , Joe_Johnson and Jeff_Withey , the remaining members of the starting 5 , only combined for 11 points .
Victor_Oladipo was second behind his backcourt mate on the Thunder with 22 points , 4 assists , 2 rebounds , 1 steal and 1 block .

The Spurs won the first and fourth quarters by 10 points each , and the held the Mavs to limited productivity in between .
Boris_Diaw was the man for San_Antonio in the game , he went 3 - for - 4 on three pointers for a game - high 19 points .
San_Antonio is 10 - 3 in March and seems to be playing their best basketball of the season when it matters most .
Believe it or not it 's true , he and Monta_Ellis put in 10 points a piece , but it was n't nearly enough to take down the defending champs on their home floor .
The Boston_Celtics ( 5 - 4 ) upset the Oklahoma_City_Thunder ( 6 - 4 ) 100 - 85 on Sunday thanks to a dominant fourth quarter .
Oklahoma_City went 2 - for - 17 in an 11 - point fourth quarter .
The Celtics on the other hand , dropped 28 points in the final 12 minutes and ran away with an impressive victory .
The Celtics are quietly one of the hottest teams in the NBA right now , as they have won 4 of their last 5 games .
Smart tallied 26 points , 8 rebounds and 3 assists in the win .
They also got another great performance from Jared_Sullinger , who has been fantastic since being re - inserted into the starting 5 .
Sullinger snatched 15 rebounds and 4 steals in the victory , while scoring just 8 points .
This was the definition of a fourth quarter collapse , as there appeared to be a lid on the basket in the final 12 minutes for the Thunder .
Russell_Westbrook continues to carry the load for the Thunder , as he collected 27 points , 5 assists , 4 rebounds , 3 steals and 2 blocks in the loss .
He did shoot only 5 - for - 20 in the loss and it 's just too hard for this Duantless Thunder team to win with a struggling Westbrook .
Only 1 player had double - digits aside from Westbrook and that 's very hard to overcome against a deep team like the Celtics .
The Brooklyn_Nets ( 9 - 22 ) defeated the Miami_Heat ( 18 - 12 ) 111 - 105 on Monday .
The win was an improbable 1 to say the least , as the Nets had only managed 2 victories away from the Barclays Center this season .
Meanwhile , Miami had defended its home court well , having posted a 13 - 6 record at the American Airlines Arena coming into tonight 's contest .
The Nets shot a solid 44 percent from the field , but a stellar 52 percent from three - point range , thanks in large part to Ellington 's performance .

As always , the Hawks were helped by their dynamic duo of big men , as both Paul_Millsap ( 21 points , 7 rebounds , 6 assists ) and Al_Horford ( 14 points , 9 rebounds ) had impressive nights .
Breakout star Bradley_Beal 's hot start came to a screaching halt against the stingy Hawks 's defense , as Beal scored just 11 points and turned the ball over a whopping 8 times .
Atlanta has been the only team to effectively keep Beal in check , as prior to Saturday the fourth - year guard had not scored fewer than 24 points in any game this season .
Overall , Washington struggled to effectively control the ball , posting 25 turnovers as a team including 7 more from All-Star point guard John_Wall .

The Hawks would slowly claw back into the game , though , trimming the lead to 6 entering the fourth quarter .
The Spurs opened the fourth on a quick 60 to vault the lead back into double - digits , but the Hawks would respond .

The Kings outshot the Grizzlies 48 percent to 44 percent and outrebounded them 44 to 37 .
Sacramento also dominated the assisting numbers , as they dished out 31 assists to Memphis 's 20 .
The key for the Grizzlies was their free - throw shooting , as they went 29 - for - 33 , with the Kings going just 11 - for - 20 .
Despite trailing by 16 at the half , the Kings made a valiant effort in a close game .
DeMarcus_Cousins struggled with his shot , but still finished with 18 points , 16 rebounds , 6 assists , 3 steals and 2 blocks in the loss .

With 27 points , 18 rebounds and 14 assists , Westbrook notched his third straight triple - double and his eighth of the season .
It was n't a 1 - man show , however , as Enes_Kanter came off the bench to notch a double - double of 27 points and 10 rebounds in just 28 minutes .
Starting center Steven_Adams also managed to notch a double - double of his own , posting 14 points and 10 boards .
As a team , Oklahoma put together one of their better shooting nights of the season , shooting 51 percent overall from the field .

Despite that , Derrick_Rose managed to put together his best performance of the season , scoring a game - high 30 points on 10 - of - 20 shooting on top of 7 rebounds and 4 assists .

The Hornets have now won 8 of their last 9 games , quickly rising up the Eastern Conference standings .
A large part of Charlotte 's push has been due to the play of point guard Kemba_Walker , who is averaging 26 points and 7 assists over the team 's last 10 contests .
Walker made another big contribution on Wednesday , scoring 16 and pulling down a surprising 8 rebounds .
He was upstaged , however , by forwards Marvin_Williams and Nic Batum , who posted 26 points apiece .

For the Magic , meanwhile , any playoff hopes are beginning to slip away , as the team now sits 9 games below .500 .
Guard Victor_Oladipo scored 25 points in one of his stronger outings of the season .
The scoring was needed , however , as the frontcourt combo of Aaron_Gordon and Dewayne_Dedmon combined for just 1 point on the night .
The Denver_Nuggets defeated the Chicago_Bulls , 125 - 107 , at United Center on Tuesday evening .
The surprising victory may have well have been one of the best road victories for the Nuggets ( 27 - 33 ) this season , considering the environment and quality of opponent .
Denver accomplished the rather improbable feat with a stellar offensive effort that saw 7 players post double - digit scoring and the team collectively shoot an outstanding 56 percent from the floor and 43 percent from three - point range .
Chicago 's cause was significantly undermined by an atypically poor shooting night from Jimmy_Butler , who posted only 8 points on a 3 - of - 13 tally from the floor .
Danilo_Gallinari led the Nuggets with 22 points , 3 rebounds and 1 steal .
Wilson_Chandler followed with 20 points , 3 rebounds , 1 assist and 1 block .

The Portland Trail_Blazers ( 43 - 37 ) defeated the Oklahoma_City_Thunder ( 54 - 25 ) 120 - 115 at Moda Center on Wednesday .
The matchup worked in favor of the Blazers , as they now are in a deadlock with the Memphis_Grizzlies for the 5 - seed in the Western Conference .
Kanter flashed his brilliant offensive play in his matchup , and led all scorers with 33 points , in addition to a whopping 20 rebounds , on 13 - of - 18 shooting .
Dion_Waiters was given the green light with all stars Westbrook and Durant on the sideline , and turned in a 25 point performance on 10 - of - 19 shooting .
Anthony_Morrow drew the start as well , and added 19 points and 3 assists .
Portland , who has surprised many this season after eclipsing their expected win total by 10 wins at this point in the season , rallied behind C.J .
The back court duo of McCollum and Lillard is dangerous to deal with at all points , but it was Lehigh shooting guard who turned in the bulk of the Blazers offense , as he finished with 26 points , 3 rebounds and 3 assists .
Lillard struggled to find his stroke from the field and scored just 11 points on 13 shots , but he added 9 assists and kept the ball movement in tact .
Aminu has been a bright spot for Portland in the second half of the season , and contributed another strong performance with 27 points , 6 rebounds , 5 assists , 3 steals and 1 blocked shot in 37 minutes of action .
Both teams play on Saturday , as the Blazers host the Minnesota_Timberwolves ( 26 - 52 ) , while the Thunder head south to take on the Sacramento_Kings ( 31 - 47 ) .
T.J._McConnell 's 12 - foot basket at the buzzer sealed the home win for the Sixers .

Gerald_Henderson was productive in a reserve role with 12 points .
McConnell compiled a modest but full stat line of 8 points , 7 assists , 6 rebounds and 2 steals .
Carmelo_Anthony 's 28 points paced the Knicks and Derrick_Rose , fresh off an infamous 1 - game absence , was right behind with 25 points .
The remainder of the starting 5 , Courtney_Lee , Porzingis and Joakim_Noah , underwhelmed , as they were only able to produce a trio of 7 - point efforts Wednesday .
Kyle_O'Quinn led the bench with a 10 - point , 15 - rebound double - double that also included 3 assists , 2 steals and 2 blocks .
The Dallas_Mavericks evened their Western Conference first - round playoff series against the host Oklahoma_City_Thunder on Monday with an 85 - 84 win in Game 2 at Chesapeake Arena .

Dirk_Nowitzki added 17 points and Salah_Mejri added a key 12 points ( 5 - 7 FG ) off the bench .
Durant matched Felton 's 21 points but shot a brutal 7 - 33 from the field and committed 7 turnovers .
Westbrook scored 19 , added 14 rebounds and dished 6 assists but shot just 8 - 22 from the floor and 1 - 6 from three - point range .
Serge_Ibaka was the only other Thunder player to reach double figures with 12 points ( 4 - 7 FG , 2 - 4 3PT , 2 - 2 FG ) .
The Thunder 's lack of offensive options beyond Durant and Westbrook loomed large , as Oklahoma_City 's offense went completely cold - - the Thunder shot 34 percent from the field and commmitted more turnovers ( 15 ) than they recorded assists ( 11 ) .
The series moves to Dallas for Game 3 , scheduled for Thursday night at 7:0 PM Eastern Time .
The Brooklyn_Nets ( 3 - 11 ) defeated the Boston_Celtics ( 7 - 6 ) 111 - 101 on Sunday .
The Celtics learned before the game that they will be without guard Marcus_Smart for up to 2 weeks due to a lower leg injury he suffered in their Friday victory over this same Nets squad .
Smart 's absence opens up a starting spot for Avery_Bradley , who continued his outstanding play Sunday with a 27 - point , 4 - rebound effort that also included 1 assist , 1 block and a pair of steals .
Bradley had averaged 18 points per game over the previous 4 outings , all in which he came off the bench .
The 24 - year - old also drained a season - high 7 three - pointers on 50 percent shooting overall from beyond the arc , leading a furious second - half comeback by the Celtics that ultimately fell short .
Boston also received a matching 27 - point effort from Isaiah_Thomas , which equaled his season high .
However , the rest of the Celtics starters could only muster relatively meager contributions , a pivotal factor in the 59 - 42 deficit they faced at halftime .
Starting forwards Amir_Johnson and Jae_Crowder only totaled 7 points between them , while Jared_Sullinger contributed 9 points , 10 rebounds , and 3 assists .
Evan_Turner paced the Boston bench with 13 points , his second consecutive outing with double - digit scoring .

Thad Young posted his fourth double - double in 5 contests ( 11 points , 12 rebounds ) , while the ageless Joe_Johnson pitched in with a 17 - point effort , his second - highest scoring total of the season .
Brooklyn improved to 3 - 11 and remain in fourth place in the Eastern Conference 's Atlantic Division .
The Los_Angeles_Clippers defeated the New_Orleans_Pelicans 133 - 105 at Staples Center on Saturday .
The Pelicans ( 7 - 17 ) were without Anthony_Davis ( rest ) , Jrue_Holiday ( toe ) and E'Twaun_Moore ( toe ) , making the game very 1 sided from the gate .
The New_Orleans reserves played physical basketball and found scoring lanes in the first half , falling just 6 points short of the Clippers ( 17 - 7 ) at the end of the second quarter .
The second half was a different story , as Los_Angeles outscored the Pelicans by 12 points in the third quarter and 10 points in the fourth quarter .
Chris_Paul dropped one of the biggest double - doubles of the season , racking up 20 points and 20 assists , with 18 of those assists coming in the first 3 quarters of action .
Paul added 5 rebounds and 3 steals on 8 - of - 16 shooting in 30 minutes of action , which was even more helpful given Blake_Griffin 's ( knee ) absence .
DeAndre_Jordan worked the pick and roll with Paul to perfection , and with no Anthony_Davis clogging the lane on the other end , Jordan found his way to 19 points and 9 rebounds rather easily .
Jamal_Crawford and Marreese_Speights added scoring help from the bench , as they finished with 22 points and 17 points , respectively .
Tim_Frazier led the Pelicans on the other end , scoring 20 points and adding 11 assists on 6 - of - 13 shooting .

The Dallas_Mavericks ( 35 - 18 ) pulled off a huge comeback to defeat the Portland Trail_Blazers ( 34 - 17 ) 111 - 101 Saturday at the American Airlines Center .
Portland held a 16 - point lead early in the fourth , but Dallas took advantage of the Trail_Blazers 's second unit and began to chip away at the deficit .
The Trail_Blazers could n't close out the Mavericks despite having plenty of chances to do so as they were doubled up in the fourth 26 - 13 .
Dirk_Nowitzki canned an open 3 to tie it up with 20 seconds remaining in the fourth .
Chandler_Parsons was a huge difference maker in overtime , scoring 10 points and also securing a key offensive rebound that he then kicked out to Monta_Ellis for a three - pointer .
Dallas ended the game on a 28 - 7 run .
The Trail_Blazers appeared to be well on their way to a third straight win to help minimize the impact of their 3 - 8 stretch to end January , but let a huge lead slip away en route to their first overtime loss of the season .
Chris_Kaman returned to the rotation after sitting out Thursday , but only contributed 4 points and 5 rebounds in 16 minutes .
Dallas 's comeback victory puts the Mavericks 1 game ahead of the Trail_Blazers in the win column .
Devin_Harris and J.J Barea provided solid production at the point guard spot in Rajon_Rondo 's absence , combining for 23 points , 13 rebounds , and 9 assists .

Milwaukee battled hard to stave off elimination on its home court in Game 4 , but simply did n't have the fire power to force a Game 7 on Thursday .
The Bucks shot 33 % from the field for the entire game and only managed 20 points in the paint .
Their leading scorer was center Zaza_Pachulia , who posted 8 points in 18 minutes on the floor .
Despite Thursday 's tough loss , the Bucks possess a talented young nucleus and are positioned to compete again in the 2015 - 16 season .

The Spurs finished this game shooting 44 percent from the field and 48 percent from the three - point line , while the Clippers went 47 percent from the floor and an awful 7 percent from deep .

Duncan continues to show no signs of slowing down this postseason , averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds while recording 4 double - doubles .
