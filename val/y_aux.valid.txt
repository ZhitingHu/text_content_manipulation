Down 5 points in the fourth , Avery_Bradley hit 2 clutch shots to tie the game with just 1 minute left in regulation .

The Philadelphia_76ers may only have 2 wins on their lowly season , but recently acquired point guard Ish_Smith has provided a spark in the backcourt for the NBA 's last place team .
A semblance of offense looks to be in motion with Smith at the helm , as the 76ers overcame a 58 - 45 halftime deficit , and were competitive through the last possessions of the game .
Smith finished with 22 points and dished out 11 assists on 8 - of - 21 shooting in 32 minutes .

Trey_Burke led the bench with 14 points .
The Jazz head to Minnesota to face the struggling Timberwolves ( 11 - 20 ) on Wednesday .
Suns point guard Eric_Bledsoe is having by far the most productive season of his career so far , making this cold stretch he has been on over his last 4 games even more uncharacteristic .
His performance Wednesday night was the worst of them all , with Bledsoe shooting just 3 - of - 15 while still managing to come up with 16 points thanks to some good free throw shooting .
But this is starting to become a trend , as Bledsoe has shot 13 - of - 47 ( 28 percent ) from the field over his last 4 contests .
Despite those horrific shooting numbers , Bledsoe has still managed to average 16 points per game over that stretch , but that is only because of his ability to get to the line .

Horford recorded 6 rebounds and 6 assists in Wednesday 's road victory over the Warriors , and when he has recorded those totals this season , the Celtics are 9 - 3 .
Even more telling is the fact that in those 12 games , Horford is averaging just 12 points , showing that he is making an big impact , even when the scoring column does n't say so .

It was just a 38 percent shooting night for the Hawks in what was a dismal performance .
All-Star big man Paul_Millsap scored 21 points to go with 8 rebounds and 4 assists .
That was about it for Atlanta , though , as no other player scored above 13 and the team consistently struggled .

Over his last 3 games , he 's now averaging 18 point and 9 rebounds , but he 'll need to do even better if the Bulls want to make a run in the playoffs .
Taj_Gibson recorded an efficient 15 points ( 6 - 12 FG , 3 - 5 FT ) and 7 rebounds , while Nikola_Mirotic added 15 points ( 3 - 11 FG , 3 - 5 3Pt , 6 - 7 FT ) of his own over 27 minutes .

In 5 of the 6 games that the Lakers have lost during their rough streak , Williams has scored at least 24 points , adding another 24 - point game against the Knicks .

Thomas recorded a game - high 30 points while scoring nearly half of his points from the free throw line , as he shot 14 - of - 14 from the charity stripe .

Bradley was n't too far behind , recording a double - double of 26 points and 10 rebounds over 39 minutes .

The Sacramento_Kings defeated the Los_Angeles Lakers,116-92 , at Golden 1 Center on Monday .
The Kings ( 9 - 15 ) came away with a blowout win to snap a three - game losing streak , but it took its toll on the home team , as they lost Rudy_Gay ( hip flexor ) and Ben_McLemore ( quad ) during the game .
Before the 2 injuries , the physical battle between DeMarcus_Cousins and Julius_Randle caused Lakers ( 10 - 17 ) head coach Luke Walton to get ejected after arguing a controversial no call on Cousins .

The Celtics ( 44 - 26 ) had come into Sunday just 2 games behind the top - seeded Cleveland_Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference , with a golden opportunity to make up further ground .
They knew they 'd have a challenge on their hands , however , as the Sixers ( 26 - 43 ) had been playing much better basketball than their record indicated and they 'd also be missing team MVP Isaiah_Thomas for a second straight contest with knee soreness .
Accordingly , Philadelphia managed to play spoiler effectively , overcoming a 13 - point fourth - quarter deficit .
Thomas 's absence certainly helped the Sixers 's cause , but they earned the upset victory by limiting Boston to 40 percent shooting from the field and 21 percent from three - point range , while also forcing 17 turnovers .

The Charlotte_Hornets defeated the Detroit_Pistons , 87 - 77 , at Spectrum Arena on Wednesday .
The Hornets ( 13 - 9 ) have often counted on their standout guard combo of Kemba_Walker and Nicolas_Batum this season to serve as the foundation of their offense , and their contributions came in particularly handy Wednesday against the Pistons ( 12 - 12 ) .
Despite the trio of remarkable performances , it was largely a defensive - minded contest , with both teams shooting under 40 percent from the field , and with the Pistons posting a particularly unsightly 15 percent success rate from behind the arc .

The Bulls then gave up an unforced turnover on a 5 - second inbound violation that destroyed their chance of victory .
The high - point man was Derrick_Rose , who finished with 25 points ( 12 - 20 FG ) , 5 rebounds and 4 assists , in 36 minutes .
Nikola_Mirotic poured in 23 points on strong 6 - 10 shooting from the field ( 4 - 7 3PT , 7 - 11 FT ) , along with 7 rebounds , 3 blocks , 2 steals and 1 assist , in 40 minutes .

The Denver_Nuggets ( 22 - 32 ) defeated the Detroit_Pistons ( 27 - 27 ) 103 - 92 on Wednesday night .

The contest was a costly 1 for both teams health - wise , but particularly for a Miami squad that was already short - handed coming in .

The victory was a crucial 1 for a Wizards squad that needs every win it can get down the stretch , and the comfortable second - half lead allowed their front - line players some much needed rest .
All 5 members of the first unit were able to play under 30 minutes for the Wizards , a welcome luxury in the latter stages of what has been a tough season for them to date .

The win brings them within 6 and half games of the Miami_Heat for the final projected playoff seed in the Eastern Conference , but they will still need to keep on winning with just 15 games left in the season .
The Grizzlies , on the other hand , continue to sit as the second seed in the West , 7 games behind the Golden_State_Warriors , but just 1 and a half games ahead of the Portland Trail_Blazers .

It was notably Ryan_Anderson , and not Anthony_Davis , that accomplished the feat , in an outstanding 37 minutes off the bench .
Despite having held a lead as large as 20 points and not having to face Davis over the final 2 quarters , the Trail_Blazers were forced to fight until the final whistle , as the Pelicans mounted a furious comeback .

The Utah_Jazz ( 8 - 7 ) held off the New_Orleans_Pelicans ( 4 - 13 ) 101 - 87 on Saturday .
Utah had a 16 - point lead going into the fourth quarter and it 's nearly impossible to beat this stingy defense with that sort of deficit .
The rebounding was the big difference in the game , as the Jazz snatched 49 boards compared to 35 for the Pelicans .
New_Orleans came into this game as the worst defense in the NBA and the 101 points allowed is a significant improvement on those ugly numbers .

The Oklahoma_City_Thunder defeated the Minnesota_Timberwolves , 112 - 100 , at Chesapeake Energy Arena on Sunday .
In the extended absence of Victor_Oladipo ( wrist ) , the Thunder ( 19 - 12 ) have naturally depended heavily on perennial All-Star Russell_Westbrook , and he 's validated their faith on countless occasions .
It was the Thunder 's pair of big men , Steven_Adams and Enes_Kanter , who turned in 22 and 20 points , respectively , to supplement a game - high 31 points from Westbrook , who also provided 15 assists , 7 rebounds , 1 steal and 1 block .

The Knicks ( 18 - 22 ) have n't exactly caught many breaks over the last 2 - plus weeks , having lost 9 of their last 10 .

The T-Wolves were led by Andrew_Wiggins once again who dropped 21 points .
Zach_LaVine also had a nice game filling - in for Ricky_Rubio , as he tallied 18 points and 7 assists in the defeat .
Karl-Anthony_Towns was having a very good game through 3 quarters , but he barely played in the fourth for an unknown reason .
The Clippers had lost 8 of 11 games before their win over the New_Orleans_Pelicans on Friday , so this added to that to start a modest two - game winning streak .
The team was led by a near triple - double from Blake_Griffin , who collected 26 points , 8 rebounds and 8 assists in the win .
They also got 20 points and 9 assists from Chris_Paul and these 2 will need to play like this going forward if they want to dig out of this hole .

Neither team reached the 50 - point mark until the 4:20 mark in the third quarter when John_Wall found Marcin_Gortat for an easy layup .
One overtime was n't enough to decide the outcome , however , as the Pacers and Wizards mustered just 4 points apiece in the first extra period .
Indiana 's George_Hill clutch three - pointer in the second OT gave the Pacers a 5 point lead with under 30 seconds remaining to help seal the victory .

Wall finished with 16 points on 7 - of - 23 shooting and added 11 assists while Gortat posted 19 points and 10 rebounds .

The New_Orleans_Pelicans ( 15 - 14 ) defeated the San_Antonio_Spurs ( 18 - 13 ) 97 - 90 on Friday .
New_Orleans has won 4 of their last 6 .
They have the talent to beat the best teams in the West , but the Pelicans lack the experience and chemistry to play as consistently from game to game as the top 8 teams in the conference .

Davis also posted 12 rebounds and 5 blocks in 38 minutes , while Anderson also posted 7 rebounds and 2 three - pointers in 33 minutes off the bench .
Tony_Parker returned for the last 2 games but did not play Friday , and it 's unlcear whether he was simply being rested on the second game of a back - to - back set or if he aggravated his hamstring injury .
The Spurs gave up 20 easy points off of 17 turnovers , pointing to their greatest weakness Friday and the likely reason why they lost the game .
The Los_Angeles_Clippers ( 51 - 28 ) defeated the Utah_Jazz ( 39 - 40 ) 102 - 99 in overtime on Friday .

James_Harden scored 6 of his 28 points in free basketball to ice the win for Houston .
The Magic are still a very young team , but are beginning to see what they have in Fournier and Aaron_Gordon , who scored a season - high 19 points on 7 - of - 11 shooting to go along with 8 rebounds .
Fournier came a basket shy of posting back - to - back 30 - point outings .
Rookie Mario_Hezonja posted his second goose egg of the season and played just 11 minutes off the bench .
While Harden led the Rockets in scoring for a second straight game , Dwight_Howard was key in the victory , collecting 14 rebounds and adding 23 points in 31 minutes .

The New_York_Knicks defeated the Minnesota_Timberwolves , 118 - 114 , at Madison Square Garden on Friday .
Carmelo_Anthony has begun to cede some of the offensive responsibility to sophomore sensation Kristaps_Porzingis in some games due to the latter 's emergence , and such was the case when these 2 teams met just 2 nights prior .
He also drained 2 key free throws with 6 seconds left , giving the Knicks ( 10 - 9 ) their final 2 points of the night and effectively sealing the win .
His stellar performance led the way on a night when the entire New_York starting 5 managed to hit double digits in the scoring column , and that also saw New_York shoot 48 percent from the field overall .
The Timberwolves ( 5 - 14 ) were paced by a 23 - point output from Zach_LaVine , who complemented the scoring with 3 assists , 2 rebounds and 1 steal .
Andrew_Wiggins contributed 19 points , 4 assists , 3 rebounds and 1 steal .

The Golden_State_Warriors defeated the Los_Angeles_Clippers 115 - 98 at Staples Center on Wednesday .
The rivalry match went in favor of the Warriors ( 19 - 3 ) , even though Stephen_Curry struggled on the floor of Staples Center again this season .
Regardless which Los_Angeles team gets put on the court , Curry is a surprising 4 - of - 28 across 3 contests this season .
Kevin_Durant also had one of his worst games in a Warriors jersey , but the team effort led by Klay_Thompson 's 24 points and the Clippers 40 percent shooting from the field was more than enough to hold a 20 point lead throughout most of the game .
After a Draymond_Green three - pointer and a Curry and - 1 layup with 2:10 left in the first quarter , Golden_State went up by 15 points and did not have to look back .
Green had the best all around performance after scoring 22 points and grabbing 5 rebounds , in addition to 4 assists and 2 steals on 8 - of - 10 shooting .
Jamal_Crawford provided 21 points off the bench to lead all Clippers scorers , but Chris_Paul , DeAndre_Jordan and Blake_Griffin combined for just 37 points on 41 shots from the field .

The Golden_State_Warriors defeated the Brooklyn_Nets , 112 - 95 , at Oracle Arena on Saturday .
Golden_State was expected to win this game easily with a 22 - point spread and they took care of business .
A 100 run to end the second quarter was a huge stretch , as it gave the Warriors an 11 - point lead , which they never relinquished from there .
It was a near wire - to - wire win , as Brooklyn 's only lead was a 1 - point advantage for less than 1 minute in the second quarter .
The assist - to - turnover ratio was decisive , as the Warriors recorded 5 more assists than the Nets , while committing 5 less turnovers .
Golden_State also dominated the rim protection , as they recorded 11 blocks to Brooklyn 's 3 .
The Nets ( 8 - 49 ) had a nearly impossible task here , but they did a nice job of hanging around and giving the Warriors a battle .
Rondae_Hollis-Jefferson was a bright spot , as he accrued 16 points and 10 rebounds in the defeat .
Brook_Lopez really struggled , as he could only muster up 9 points , 4 rebounds and 5 assists , while committing 4 turnovers on 3 - of - 13 shooting .
Sean_Kilpatrick was a nice spark off the bench , providing 15 points , 10 rebounds , 2 assists and 2 steals .
